configuration: 25 servers per rack Redundancy requirement: no single point of failure\nDesign a three-tier data center network architecture using the specifications below:\n(1) Use Top-of-Rack (ToR) switches\n(2) Each ToR switch: 48 × 1 Gbps server ports + 4 × 10 Gbps uplinks\n(3) Dual uplinks per ToR for redundancy (4) Maximum over-subscription ratio: 4:1\n(5) Each aggregation switch: 48 × 10

switches required\nCalculate the number of aggregation switches needed\nSpecify the number of core switches required\nDraw a labeled network topology diagram showing: All switch types and quantities\nConnection speeds between layers\nRedundancy paths Number of Racks needed: Number of ToR switches needed\n- This needs some nuance as there are some issues to be addressed:\n- Each Switch has 48 x 1 Gbps Server ports, yet the servers can support up to 10 Gbps\n- This basically means that the supplied switch would be a bottleneck as it does not meet the speed of the 10Gbps interface the server supports\n- This is worth mentioning, yet can not be remedied by a work around unless a switch with a higher speed is supplied, therefore, each server will connect TO ONE PORT on the switch.\n- Following along, each Switch can host 48 Servers, and since there is no requirement to be Port-Efficient or COST-EFFECTIVE , we should not utilize all the Switch's ports:\n- Having only one switch per rack is a single point of failure, a common design is to have two ToR switches per rack[1], therefore my final answer is: Crucial point Each server connects one of its NICs to the first ToR switch in the rack.\nThe same server connects its second NIC to the second ToR switch in the rack.

Core switches needed\n1. We need to check port capacity so constraint (7) is achievable. Since a coer switch has 32 x 40 Gbps ports it can accomodate 7 ports for 7 aggregation switches, however a single core switch is a single point of failure, so we address by having 2 Core switches, which will yield us 6 + 1 total ports connected.\n2. We need to satisfy the Peak Aggregate Bandwidth requirement of 2Tbps thus the core switching layer needs to have an uplink Bandwidth of 2Tbps This satisfies our requirement of 2Tbps peak aggregate Bandwidth.\n<br><img alt=\"NET ARCH.svg\" src=\"studies/big-data/net-arch.svg\" target=\"_self\">Calculate the following metrics for your design:\nTotal uplink capacity from access layer to aggregation layer\nEffective bandwidth after applying the 4:1 oversubscription ratio\nBisection bandwidth of the complete network\nPower consumption assuming: Each server: 400W\nEach ToR switch: 200W\nEach aggregation switch: 800W\nEach core switch: 1200W\nPUE factor: 1.6 Bisection Bandwidth: Minimum bandwidth between any two equal halves of the network when cut along the narrowest path. min(Total Uplink Capacity ÷ Oversubscription Ratio)\nTotal Uplink Capacity: Effective bandwidth after applying 4:1 Oversubscription Rule, Downlink Bandwidth is effectively therefore: Bisection Bandwidth The Narrowest cut is between the aggregation and core layers\nThe bisection bandwidth is half of the total capacity of these Links\nSince we already know that our peak aggregate bandwidth is 2.56 Tbps our Bisection Bandwidth is Half of that which is 1.28 Tbps Full calculation Power Consumption: Server Power:&nbsp;\nToR Switch Power: &nbsp;\nAggregation Switch Power:&nbsp;\nCore Switch Power: A company has an HDFS cluster with the following specifications: 20 DataNodes, each DataNode has 10 TB storage capacity, default replication factor of 3, and a block size of 128 MB\nTotal raw storage capacity\nEffective storage capacity (considering replication)\nMaximum number of blocks the cluster can store\nMemory required for NameNode if each block metadata takes 150 bytes Total Raw Storage Capacity Effective Storage Capacity, considering replication Since we are replicating by a factor of 3 and Namenode metadata/file metric is NOT DEFINED it is a simple division by 3 for raw Storage Capacity. maximum number of blocks the cluster can store Memory required for Name-node if each block, metadata takes 150 bytes Number of blocks required\nTotal storage consumed (with replication)\nMinimum number of DataNodes needed to store this file\nImpact on cluster if 2 DataNodes fail simultaneously Number of Blocks required\nWe need to consider replication factor of 3 thus,\nIF the question specifies the number of blocks WITHOUT replication then, the blocks of the 10GB file WITHOUT REPLICATION is: Total Storage Consumed (With replication) Minimum number of Datanodes needed to store this file\nThe Minimum number of Datanodes needed to store this file is 3 Datanodes, As per HDFS Lecture Slide 11, default replication parameters for 3 factor replication. Impact on cluster if 2 Datanodes fail simultaneously: NameNode detects loss of heartbeat signals of Datanode\nA Timeout is reached and NameNode begin re-replication of Blocks on the 3rd Datanode, since we have a replication factor of 3. Performance degradation is seen, when re-replication is commenced.\nStorage Capacity Decreases as 2 Datanodes died, 20TB of Raw Storage Capacity are Lost\nData is still Available No data is lost, before re-replication as there is still 1 intact DataNode Available as we use a replication factor of 3.

Replication Factor of 3\nSwitch Topology (Of A 3 Tier Design) to showcase Rack Awareness\nTo satisfy these requirements for a placement strategy the Hadoop HDFS default strategy is probably best suited.\nFirst Replica Placemnet: The first replica of a block is placed on a DataNode in the same rack as the client writing the data. if no datanode is available a randomly chosen datanode is chosen. This satisfies requirement (1) Second Replica Placement: The second replica is placed on a datanode in the nearest different rack than the rack of the first replica. This satisfies the requirement (3) Third Replica Placement: The third replica is placed on a different DataNode within the same rack as the second replica.

The reducer can then easily iterate through this list, identify the user information by its \"U\" tag, identify the order information by its \"O\" tag, and perform the join.\nuser1,&nbsp;(\"U\", \"Alice\", 25)\nuser2,&nbsp;(\"U\", \"Bob\", 30) user1,&nbsp;(\"O\", \"order1\", \"laptop\", 1000)\nuser2,&nbsp;(\"O\", \"order2\", \"phone\", 500)\nuser1,&nbsp;(\"O\", \"order3\", \"tablet\", 300)\nThe Map-reduce framework will then take this full list of key-value pairs, sort them by key, and group the values for each key. This grouped data is what gets sent to the Reducer:\nKey:&nbsp;user1\nValues:&nbsp;[(\"U\", \"Alice\", 25), (\"O\", \"order1\", \"laptop\", 1000), (\"O\", \"order3\", \"tablet\", 300)] Key:&nbsp;user2\nValues:&nbsp;[(\"U\", \"Bob\", 30), (\"O\", \"order2\", \"phone\", 500)] This grouped output is the direct input for the&nbsp;reduce&nbsp;function described in your note.reduce(userId, values): userInfo = null orders = [] for value in values: if value.tag == \"U\": userInfo = value else: orders.append(value) for order in orders: emit(userId, userInfo + order) (user1, (Alice, 25, order1, laptop, 1000))\n(user1, (Alice, 25, order3, tablet, 300))\n(user2, (Bob, 30, order2, phone, 500))\nExample on total orders form Users\nreduce(userId, values) {\ntotal = 0;\nfor value in values { if value.tag = \"O\"; total += value.orderValue;\n} emit(userId, total)\n} public class MapSideJoinMapper extends Mapper&lt;...&gt; { private HashMap userMap = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); @Override protected void setup(Context context) { // Load small dataset into memory Path[] cacheFiles = context.getLocalCacheFiles(); BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader( new FileReader(cacheFiles[0].toString())); String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { String[] parts = line.split(\",\"); userMap.put(parts[0], parts[1] + \",\" + parts[2]); } } @Override public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, Context context) { // Join with in-memory data String[] order = value.toString().split(\",\"); String userInfo = userMap.get(order[1]); if (userInfo != null) { context.write(new Text(order[1]), new Text(userInfo + \",\" + value)); } } }\nMapper 1: user1: \"Alice\", 25, (Laptop, 1000), (tablet,300)\nMapper 2: user1: \"Alice\", 25, (TV,3000)\nThe reducers are then responsible for reducing these records from the map phase.\nIn short the map is carrying out some of the heavy work of the reducers, grouping many orders in one record instead of single records entries. Aggregate data on the mapper side in-memory\nAvoid shuffle and sort overhead Much faster than reduce side join\nCan only be used if the data can fit in memory on the mapper side\npublic class TopNMapper extends Mapper&lt;...&gt; { private TreeMap topMap = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;(); @Override public void map(Object key, Text value, Context context) { String[] tokens = value.toString().split(\"\\t\"); String word = tokens[0]; int count = Integer.parseInt(tokens[1]); topMap.put(count, word); // Keep only top 10 in mapper if (topMap.size() &gt; 10) { topMap.remove(topMap.firstKey()); } } @Override protected void cleanup(Context context) { // Emit local top 10 for (Map.Entry entry : topMap.entrySet()) { context.write(new IntWritable(entry.getKey()), new Text(entry.getValue())); } } } word: &lt;Doc, number of occurences&gt;[]\n// Mapper public void map(Text docId, Text content, Context context) { Map wordCounts = new HashMap&lt;&gt;(); for (String word : content.toString().split(\"\\\\s+\")) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } for (Map.Entry entry : wordCounts.entrySet()) { context.write( new Text(entry.getKey()), new Text(docId + \":\" + entry.getValue()) ); } } // Reducer public void reduce(Text word, Iterable docList, Context context) { StringBuilder postings = new StringBuilder(); for (Text doc : docList) { postings.append(doc.toString()).append(\", \"); } context.write(word, new Text(postings.toString())); } Input Split Size: Balance between parallelism and overhead\nCompression: Reduce I/O but consider CPU cost\nData Locality: Schedule tasks near data\nCombine Files: Avoid small file problem Reuse Objects: Avoid creating new objects in loops\nUse Combiners: Reduce network traffic\nFilter Early: Reduce data in mappers\nCustom Partitioners: Balance reducer load\nRun a background task to run slow process and kill the slowest once you get the result. The original mapper might run close to a datanode in the same rack, yet, the network of the rack might get congested as HDFS and other processes are running, therefore running a background task might run on a different uncontested sub-network.\nSome keys have more data than others\ncauses reducers to take longer tiem\nExample: \"The\" appears millions of times compared to other words in an inverted index Sampling data, lets you detec skewed keys\nSalting, add random suffix to skewed data You can Salt on Keys, and every key will have the same suffix\nOr you can salt on each key instance, and every key record will have different suffix custom partitioner: build your own custom partitioner than consistent hashing (risky)\nSalting Example\n// step 1: add random salt\nmap(key, value): if(isSkewedKey(key)): salt= random.nextInt(10) emit(key + \"_\" + salt, value) else: emit(key,value)\n// aggregate the salted keys at reducer Salting Does not Produce Aggregation\nYou will end up with key_&lt;salt&gt;: value entries in the final output of mapreduce\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Common Patterns in
